## Deployment

To deploy this project via uvicorn (ASGI server implementation) run

```bash
uvicorn main.app:app
```

By default this will listen to `localhost` and port `8000`.
To listen to desired host nad port pass the `--host <host>` and `--port <port>` flags accordingly.

If you want to listen on all host and `HTTP` request (with port 80)
```bash
uvicorn main.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```
